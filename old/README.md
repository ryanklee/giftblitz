# Giftblitz

An app meant to eventually propose a new UX for gift matching (aka secret santa) apps, while solving barrier-to-entry issues I have identified with current implementations.

Currently just the backend, written in JavaScript, using Express, Node.js and MongoDB.

Todo:

* Migrate to ASP.NET Core MVC 2
* Implement front-end
